        Aside from learning to program and doing my best to stay physically fit
        the other joy in my life is our two dogs, Brutus and Neltje. They are
        both island mutts from St. Thomas in the United States, Virgin Islands.
        (This is also where I met my girlfriend Alicia, so lots of good things
        come from the VI!) In 2017 after Hurricanes Irma and Maria left the
        islands in poor shape, without electricity and other comforts, I spent a
        lot of time volunteering (lots of free time since my place of employment
        blew away) at the Humane Society of St. Thomas where I came to love the
        spirit of the local dogs affectionately called "Coconut Retrievers."
